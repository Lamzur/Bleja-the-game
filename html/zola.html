				Main and ONLY designer on the game. He is the one coding this site so you don't have to believe
				everything that is said about him here. Doesn't code so good but copes with that by drawing and 
				designing like a hipster with no job. Usually gets the job done but when he doesn't work on the 
				game for a week, he forgets almost everything.
