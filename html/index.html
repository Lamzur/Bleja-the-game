				A 2D game taking place in our hometown, capturing the essence of times spent there.
				The name, which is a slang for get together is something we used quite often,
				therefore it became a symbol for any form of social encounters between us. 
				Taking inspiration from games such as 
				<a class="ho" href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a>, and
				<a class="ho" href="https://madguy.itch.io/streets-of-rogue" target="_blank">Streets of Rogue</a>,
				it is mainly a fighting game with exploring, NPCs, mini games and more!
				We strive towards creating a game that is not only interesting to play,
				but visually stunning, along with music that everyone will enjoy.
				Follow us, and you will see the creative process behind the idea,
				as well as everything else you want to know about our journey.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the game is finished, except things such as:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li id="animation"> Wicked animations!</li>
				<li>Gameplay to make you feel like you've lived in our town!</li>
				<li>Amazing pixel art done by people who have <span id="art">no professional art background!<span></li>
				<li>Storytelling you couldn't even find in a <a class="blackhover" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/" target="_blank">Quentin Tarantino</a> movie!</li>
				<li>A lot of violence and an R rated videogame in a nutshell.</li>
				<li>Yourself willing to give us money to continue making games!</li>
