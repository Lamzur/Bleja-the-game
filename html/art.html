				One of the most challenging things was to come up with an idea for the artstyle and remain original at the same time.
				We opted for a pixel theme since we liked the concept and it was our initial idea.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, we didn't think it would be as hard, and soon were reminded that being an animator is hard work.
				Here is how it started:
			</p>
			<img id="art1" src="art1.png" alt="first_idea">
			<p class="wrap_text">
				This is the demo version of our character design.<br>
				So a couple of things to note:
			</p>
			<ul class="wrap_text">
				<li>It looks bland and ugly.</li>
				<li>Not what we initially imagined.</li>
				<li>Overall bad proportions.</li>
				<li>Bad shading.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>
				Finding what's wrong and fixing it was hard for someone new to this, but with a few tweaks
				here and there a new design was born, arguably even worse than the last.
			</p>
			<img id="art2" src="art2.png" alt="second_idea">
			<p class="wrap_text">
				<br>
				The second (better)version.<br>
				As well as the last one, here's some things about it:
			</p>
			<ul class="wrap_text">
				<li>Shows more detail.</li>
				<li>Better shading.</li>
				<li>Still looks amateur.</li>
				<li>Bad view angle.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>
				Eventually we changed the game idea from top-down to 2D view.
				This was the turning point in the style since up untill now we focused on a single idea.
			</p>
			<p>
				After a few attempts and many more scrap ideas that we didn't show you, we ended up with this:
			</p>
			<img class="gif" src="ilija.gif">
			<img class="gif" src="lazar.gif">
			<img class="gif" src="dudu.gif">
			<p class="wrap_text">
				Final .gif product of our hard work.
			</p>
			<ul class="wrap_text">
				<li>It looks simple yet "enough".</li>
				<li>We liked it so much, we made an animation right after.</li>
				<li>The style brings out our characteristics perfectly.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>
				When we're finished with the drawing, we export the animation as a spritesheet.<br>
				We usually export it in a 4 - single frame images that animate again in our engine.
				<div id="frames">
					<img class="frame" src="lazar_running/lazar_trcanje_0000_Layer-4.png" alt="frame_1">
					<img class="frame" src="lazar_running/lazar_trcanje_0001_Layer-3.png" alt="frame_2">
					<img class="frame" src="lazar_running/lazar_trcanje_0002_Layer-2.png" alt="frame_3">
					<img class="frame" src="lazar_running/lazar_trcanje_0003_Layer-1.png" alt="frame_4">
				</div>
				It just goes to show how much time something can take if you really put effort in.<br>
				When we started, we had little to none experience in this field, now we're off to drawing a full - on game.
