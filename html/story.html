				We can begin by telling you about our birthplace, which is a small town located in northern part of Serbia,
				in the autonomous province of Vojvodina. We met in high school and had the same programming teacher,
				and began hanging around soon after. Long story short, the idea for making a game started when
				we were trying to find ways to earn money, and thought that this is the perfect idea.
				The gory-like dark game was perfect for us, and we all played video games growing up (who didn't?)
				So it was going to be a fun side thing for us while trying to make something good at the same time.
			</p>
			<h2>So how do you start developing a game?</h2>
			<p>
				Good question, we don't know. All we did is start doing things that kind of works. In the beggining we made gifs and exported them to make character animations, it doesn't work like that. But eventually we got it right, and it goes to show that you can do anything if you are willing to really do it.

			<h3>What does bleja mean?</h3>
			<p>
				Like we said earlier, the word bleja is a slang, it is pretty common in the Balkans.
				It got to the point where we were talking complete gibberish every day and thought it was extremely fun.
				Hence, we made the name of the game sound stupid, and laughed about it, a lot.

				Currently, we are all doing different things, in different towns, studying different things, but
				we plan on resuming our work as soon as possible!
